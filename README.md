## Problem description

Given a list of genetic variants in compressed Variant Call Format (VCF) files (one file per chromosome) and gene coordinates in compressed GENCODE GTF file, develop a command-line tool which for each variant finds:
  1. List of overlapping genes
  2. List of genes within +/-200000 base pairs from the variant
  3. Nearest gene
